Inheritance: It is allow us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class

Parent Class: Is the class being inherited from,also  called base class
Child Class: Is the class that inherits from another class,also called derived class

Types of inheritances:

1.Single: Single parent to single Child

2.Multi-Lever: Multiple parent classes to single child class with the concept of one after another.

3.Hierarchical: Single parent class to multiple child classes which are present at same level

4.Multiple: Multiple Parent classes to Single child class at a time.
ex: class c(p1,p2)

Note: If Bothe parent classes containe a method with same name then python will always consider the order of parent classes in the declaration in the child class.

class c(p1,p2) ==> P1 method will be considered by child class
class c(p2,p1) ==> P2 method will be considered by child class

5. Hybrid: The combination of single,mutil-level,Hierarchical and Multiple inheritances
Method Resolution Order(MRO) is decided based on MRO algorithm.

6.Cyclic: One class to another class in a cyclic way

ex: class A(A):pass
ex2: class A(B): pass
     class B(A):pass

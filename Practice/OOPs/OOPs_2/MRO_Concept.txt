Method Resolution Order

1. In hibrid Inheritance, Method resolution order will decided based on MRO algorithm
2. This algorithm is also known as c3 algorithm
3. samuele pedroni proposed this algorithm
4. It follows "DLR(Depth first left to right)". i.e., Child will get more priority than parent class.
5. Left parent will get more priority than right parent
Example:
MRO(X) = X+Merge(MRO(P1),MRO(P2),MRO(P3)..parent list). Here P1,P2,P3 etc are direct parent classes of X

Note:
1.Object is pythons inbuilt class
2.Every Class in python is a child class of Object Class either directly or indirectly.
3. If our defined class is not a child of any other class then it is direct child class of Object class
4. We can define MRO of any class by using mro() function
ex: print(ClassName.mro())
